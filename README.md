# @WeRateDogs Data Analysis ;

The goal of this project is to test the knowledge and skills in data preparation and analysis. 
The dataset we will be processing, (analyzing and visualizing) is 
the archive of tweets from the Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

We have in our possession the WeRateDogs twitter archive which contains basic data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5,000+ tweets.
